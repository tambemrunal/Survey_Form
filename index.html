                Quality is at the heart of education. It influences what students learn, how well they learn and what benefits they draw from their education.

                The quest to ensure that students achieve decent learning outcomes and acquire values and skills that help them play a positive role in their societies is an issue on the policy agenda of nearly every country.
                
                As many governments strive to expand basic education, they also face the challenge of ensuring that students stay in school long enough to acquire the knowledge they need to cope in a rapidly changing world.</p>
